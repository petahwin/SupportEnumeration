Intel MKL is available on the omega nodes: IT IS THREADSAFE!!!
ScaLapack for scalable, parallel implementation of linear algebra utils, possibly
threadsafe; do some more research on that

use the queue "phitest" in order to gain access to GPU nodes for benchmarking

In order to check condition of best response
    1. Get the payoff of any one action in the support, given other player's
       mixed strategy
    2. Iterate through the entire action space of the player and compute the 
       payoff, given other player's strategy; if resulting payoff > prior payoff,
       then dump the candidate strategy
