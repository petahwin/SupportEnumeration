<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The computation of Nash equilibria has practical applications in economics, political science, biology and numerous other fields. However, determining the set of all Nash equilibria for a given strategic game is a computationally expensive process. In order to scale back the duration of computation by at the very least a constant factor, we utilize a few platforms including multicore and GPU architectures to parallelize the computation. We present a few algorithms that take advantage of the properties of each platform and evaluate the extent to which the support enumeration method of computing Nash equilibria fits into each platform's parallelization models.
