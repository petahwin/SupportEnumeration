# SupportEnumeration
Serial and Parallel implementation and benchmarking of Support 
Enumeration Algorithm to solve Nash Equilibria

# Building
In order to build all codes, we need the following:

load the following modules:

Langs/Intel/14
Lang/Cuda/6.0

All necessary source files:

GPUsupEnum.cu
OMPsupEnum.c
SerialsupEnum.c
printUtils.c
printUtils.h
readData.c
subsets.c

Simply run "make" to build all codes

The following three python scripts are used primarily
for diagnostic and testing purposes and are unnecessary
to run the C codes

memcheck.py
supportPairs.py
supEnum.py

# Running

The usage of the codes is as follows:

./GPUsupEnum *.easy [optional posint arg]

./OMPsupEnum *.easy numThreads

./SerialsupEnum *.easy

For the GPU code, the number of threads per block
can optionally be set, otherwise defaults to 512

For the OMP code, numThreads must be a positive int
arg

All three codes require as input *.easy files,
generated by scripts within the subdirectory games/

In order to ensure that games can be generated, DO
NOT manipulate or move the files gamut.jar, 
convEasyParse.py or genGameEasy.sh, and ensure
that a python interpreter with argparse capability, and
a java compiler have been loaded.

To generate a game using GAMUT, refer to the GAMUT user's
manual. 

To generate a *.easy game for the codes, run
./genGameEasy.sh -g [gameType] -actions [no. of actions],

where the -g and -actions flags specify what type of game
we wish to generate and how many actions each player has.
Again, the GAMUT user's manual will provide additional
details. "genGameEasy.sh" generates 2-player games.

The script will create 2 files, one of which will be 
appended with .easy; this file can be run by the codes

# Benchmarking

Benchmarking data and scripts can be found in the subdir
benchmarking/

The scripts need not be run with arguments; please check
the source in the scripts for any questions.

RUN THE BENCHMARKING SCRIPTS ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFULLY 
CALLING MAKE TO BUILD THE CODES

GPUbenchmark.sh writes to GPUdata.log

OMPbenchmark.sh writes to OMPdata.log

Serialbenchmark.sh writes to Serialdata.log

The scripts will benchmark using the files specified
in testFiles.txt; these local file names specified in
testFiles.txt will be searched for in the games/
subdirectory
