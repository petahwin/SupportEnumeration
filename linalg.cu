/* big just stores max of whatever
sum is just an accumulator
temp is just used for swapping
i, j and k are just counter values
I assume that imax has to do with the index at which the max is found, the argmax if you will
I don't know what dum is for
vv stores scaling of each row
d is a parity value; useless
